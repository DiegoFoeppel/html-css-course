        JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.

        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>
        What is HTML?
    </h3>
    <!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and
    describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
    etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.

    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:

    The opening tag
    The closing tag
    The actual element
    You can learn more at MDN Web Docs.
